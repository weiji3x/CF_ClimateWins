# ClimateWins Machine Learning Project

## Project Motivation
ClimateWins, a European nonprofit organization, is interested in using machine learning to help predict the consequences of climate change around Europe and, potentially, the world.

## **Project Objective**
 - To investigate the various machine learning models available for the prediction of weather conditions using temperature data.
 - To identify the best machine learning model for the most accurate predictions.

## **Data Set**
The dataset includes open-source data set from European Climate Assessment & Dataset (ECA&D) which weather observations data from 18 different weather stations across Europe from the late 1800s to 2022.
 Dataset not included in the repository due to size restriction.

**Dataset Provided:**
- Dataset-weather-prediction-dataset-processed.csv
- Dataset-Answers-Weather_Prediction_Pleasant_Weather.csv

## **Folder Structure**
**04-2024 Instacart Basket Analysis (Main Project Folder)**
- **01 Project Management(Sub Folder)**
  - Instacart project brief.
    <br/>
    <br/>
- **03 Scripts(Sub Folder)**
  - Contains Jupyter notebooks with pyhton codes used for the data analysis.
  <br/>

## **Deliverables**
Presentation on a comprehensive analysis of machine learning model prediction of weather condition, supported with python codes & visualisation, translated into actionable recommendations for the company.
